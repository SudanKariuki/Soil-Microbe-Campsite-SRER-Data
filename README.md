# Soil-Microbe-Campsite-SRER-Data
Data and Analyses for Study on Soil Microbial Activity in Campsites at Santa Rita Experimental Range

Abstract:
Recreational camping has been shown to suppress plant cover and expand bare ground area.
These shifts have important implications for soil health. We used campsites in a semiarid 
savanna at the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) in Arizona to test the hypotheses that:
1) recreational camping limits plant cover and soil microbial activity, and 2) the degrading 
impacts of camping on soil microbial activity are tempered by the fertility island effect
of Prosopis. Camping disturbance did not influence any sampled measures of edaphic properties,
plant cover, or soil microbial biomass and exoenzyme activities. However, the presence of 
Prosopis resulted in elevated litter, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and dissolved organic 
carbon (DOC). Multiple linear regression models suggest that observed resistance of soil 
microbial activities to camping disturbance may be due to increased availability of organic 
C and N substrates beneath Prosopis. This study emphasizes the importance of plant-soil 
feedbacks, which mediate moisture and substrate availability, in soil ecological responses 
to recreational disturbance.
